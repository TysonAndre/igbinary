Compiling igbinary from source on Windows
=========================================

This guide is added for packagers or developers of the igbinary project.

Installing through pecl is probably easier for users of igbinary?

Setting up a Windows VM
-----------------------

If you don't have windows installed:

1. Install a VM from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ (E.g. Windows 7 IE11)

Installing Visual Studio
------------------------

1. Download the version of Visual Studio needed to build the newest version of PHP (mentioned on https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild#building_pecl_extensions)
   At the time of writing, that was [Visual Studio Community Edition 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)
2. Install Visual Studio 2015. (Use custom installation, make sure that all C++ features are enabled)

Downloading PHP
---------------

See https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild

Prefer downloading stable releases of php?

(This hasn't been tested yet on the suggested VM)

Building igbinary
-----------------

See https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild#building_pecl_extensions

### Install APCU (optional?)

Note: The Windows build hasn't worked for a while in 5.6, so there may be compilation errors or test failures.

TODO: Make sure that `config.w32` works without APCU installed.

> 1. Open the extension's page on PECL ( APCu)
> 2. Download the extension source either by:
> 
>    -    downloading a source archive
>    -    fetching the source from the extension's repository (link can be found under *Browse Source*)
> 3. Create a directory named pecl on the same level as your PHP source directory, e.g. C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\pecl
> 4. Extract or clone the extension source code to the pecl directory
> 
>    - if cloning, clone to a subdirectory, e.g. C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\pecl\apcu
>    - source code archive should already contain a subdirectory named e.g. apcu-4.0.7
> 5. Open a command prompt, run the setvars script, and enter your PHP source directory
> 6. Rebuild the configure script by running:
> 
>    ```
>    buildconf
>    ```
> 
> 7. Executing `configure --help` should now contain an option to enable APCu
> 
>    ```
>    --enable-apcu    Whether to enable APCu support
>    ```
> 
> 8. Configure and build:
> 
>    ```
>    configure --disable-all --enable-cli --enable-apcu
>    ```
> 
>    ```
>    nmake
>    ```
> 
> 9. Test the binary with a php -m command, to make sure APCu is loaded

### Install igbinary

Similar to the above instructions.

1. (This isn't released yet, skip this step and download from github)
   Open the extension's page on PECL ( APCu)
2. Download the extension source either by:

   -    downloading a source archive
   -    fetching the source from the extension's repository (link can be found under *Browse Source*)
        https://github.com/igbinary/igbinary/
3. Create a directory named pecl on the same level as your PHP source directory, e.g. C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\pecl
4. Extract or clone the extension source code to the pecl directory

   - if cloning, clone to a subdirectory, e.g. C:\php-sdk\phpdev\vc11\x86\pecl\apcu
   - source code archive should already contain a subdirectory named e.g. apcu-4.0.7
5. Open a command prompt, run the setvars script, and enter your PHP source directory
6. Rebuild the configure script by running:

   ```
   buildconf
   ```

7. Executing `configure --help` should now contain options.
   (`config.m4` currently has no options. May allow disabling apcu support in the future, etc.)

   ```

   ```

8. Configure and build:
   One may want to set CFLAGS to -O2 so it will be faster?

   ```
   configure
   ```

   ```
   nmake
   ```

9. Test the binary with a php -m command, to make sure APCu is loaded
10. Run the unit tests. Most should pass, some should be skipped (Or be expected failures(XFAIL)), none should fail.

    ```
    nmake test
	```
